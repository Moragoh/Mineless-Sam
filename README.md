## Gameplay
- Welcome to Mineless! You will be playing as one of the Mine Overseers, tasked with meeting quotas and managing your miners.

- This is the Miner Overseer view, where most of your work will be done. On the left is the quota you must meet, along with how many miners you must rescue by the end of the level. Meet the mineral quota with enough of your miners alive to progress!

- The caves with the minerals in them are colored yellow. Make your miners dig their way to these caves to start collecting the valuable resources.

- But our miners also need to eat! Route your miners to the green caves to gather food so they can stay alive. If their hunger (green bar) reaches zero, they will start losing health (red bar). Put your miners to work, but make sure they survive!

- If you want to stop playing at any time, no worries! You can save your game and return to the caves, where everything will be just as you left it.

- At the end of the day, retire to your room for some much-needed rest. Tomorrow will have it's share of minerals that need mining, and miners that need saving.

- The mines are a desolate and dangerous place, with strict quotas that must be met. Can you deliver all the minerals as requested? Can you do it while keeping all of your miners alive? You'll need to come up with efficient pathways and robust networks. You'll need to find a way to do iot all while _mining less._
